# 🐶🥞 Chihuahua or Muffin? 
# Image Classification with Teachable Machine

A lighthearted take on one of AI’s most iconic meme challenges with a trained model.

## 📌 Overview

This project is a simple yet entertaining image classifier that identifies whether an image contains a Chihuahua or a Muffin—inspired by Karen Zack’s viral “Animals vs. Food” series and the classic meme that confused humans and AI alike.

Built using Google’s Teachable Machine, this model demonstrates how approachable machine learning has become, even for quirky and ambiguous tasks that once highlighted AI’s limitations. With renewed attention from discussions like Andreessen Horowitz’s recent AI presentations, the Chihuahua or Muffin problem remains a fun example of how far AI has come—and how far it still has to go.
